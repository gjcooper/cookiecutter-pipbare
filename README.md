# CookieCutter Pip-Bare

An extremely bare bones cookiecutter template for python projects intended to be pip-installed

Inspired by: [wdm0006](https://github.com/wdm0006/cookiecutter-pipproject)

The original cookiecutter project can be found:

[cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)

## Using CookieCutter for your project

    $ pip install cookiecutter
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/gjcooper/cookiecutter-pipbare

The setup script will ask you some basic information including name and email address which will then be used in your new project.

## If you are publishing your project to PyPI

You can follow the instructions at [Peter Downs Blog](http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html)
 
## Purpose

The purpose here is to streamline the setup of a bare bones python project. It is super minimalistic, ignoring documentation other than a Readme. It will set up for tests, but only standard unittest.
